# Rocket League ... but 2D!

It’s not the same game as last year I promise

## Description

The game consists of up to four????? players evenly divided into two teams, trying to hit
a large soccer ball into a goal on the other team’s side of the screen. The game view is from the
side, showing a profile of the cars, ball, and goals. There’s also boost probably to make your car
fly. There’s physics like gravity and the ball bounces. The team that has the most goals after 5
minutes wins. There’s a menu screen where you can choose player amount and game settings
like color.

## Controls

The first car is controlled with WASD and boost with Q, the second is controlled by
arrow keys and shift for boost. Any more cars will have some other controls I think. Escape
pauses and you can exit to the menu or restart the game.

## Abstract

That’s the wikipeada summary for rocket league.
